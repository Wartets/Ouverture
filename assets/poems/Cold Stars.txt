Cold Stars

The other night,
When we were together, without even talking.
We were looking at the sky, surrounded by stars.
Illuminated by the rays of the moon.
In the dulcet silence of the sound of the wind.

I wasn’t confident yet by what I was feeling,
It was equivalent to a curious sensation swirling around me.
Time went by, my troubles after him were not worries for me anymore.
I no longer had any concern, only cozy thoughts ran through me.

We were lying on the ground, hand in hand.
The cold of the outside tried to catch us,
But deep inside me, it was warm.
Warmer than anywhere.
And then I fell, comparable to one of the falling stars we saw,
I fell, I fell in love.

My heart wasn’t doubtful, as peaceful as that night.
Since then, I never stopped thinking over how burning it was.
But now, I am all alone in the shadows outside the light of the moon.
With a missing piece in my middle,
You.
