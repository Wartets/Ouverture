Childhood

In the tapestry of time, memories unfold,
A journey back in moments, both tender and bold.
From mornings ablaze with childhood delight,
To cartoons embraced in the soft morning light.

Cabins of blankets, a fortress of dreams,
Imagination's realm, where nothing's as it seems.
Our minds, unburdened by life's heavy load,
Innocence reigning on the path we strode.

The world was our canvas, a playground so vast,
Dirt-stained attire, carefree and steadfast.
Critical judgments in their infancy,
All was enchanting, from the mundane to the fancy.

Nostalgia creeps in, as we now discern,
The treasures of youth, for which we yearn.
A time when each day was an unexplored story,
Unaware of the future, bathed in morning glory.

Oh, how we long for those simpler days,
Where time moved slowly in its meandering ways.
Yet, here we stand, with memories so dear,
Woven in the fabric of a time crystal clear.

So, let us embrace the past with a wistful smile,
For in reminiscence, we travel a timeless mile.
Though we've aged, and the world has transformed,
The essence of those moments forever warmed.
