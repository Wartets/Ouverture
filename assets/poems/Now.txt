Now

All we have is now,
this fleeting breath,
this quiet room
filled with shadows of laughter.

All we ever had is now,
the touch of sunlight
on worn-out floors,
the hum of clocks
counting moments
we barely hold.

No future waits in folded hands,
no past returns
with its faded echoes.
Thereâ€™s only the air we breathe,
the way your voice
softens the silence.
